## What are the highlights from this project?
My data analysis project focused on time series analysis and time series forecast. By processing the data and using the Prophet model to build a time series forecast model, I supported my stakeholders in anticipating future performance, which is crucial to optimize resource allocation and support strategic planning. Despite initial data challenges in model selection, my efforts resulted in accurate predictions of total purchases for up to 4 currencies, providing a remarkable lift to the Finance team.
